Graphs and Trees:

Graph: a pair G = <V,E>
	* V is a set (called vertices or nodes)
	* E is a set of pairs from V (called edges)

Ex. G = {{1,2,3}, {(1,2), (3,2)}}

G is directed - edges are ordered pairs
G is undirected - edges are sets

* our graphs are undirected by default.


Path in G: sequence <v1,v2,...,vn> of vertices such that (v1,v2),...,(vn-1,vn)
are edges of G.

Length of path = # of edges

Simple Path: all vertices are distinct. 

Vertex t is reachable frmo vertex s if there is an s-t path <s,...,t>

G is connected if for every pair u,v in V, u is reachable from v

Cycle in G: a path <v0,...vn> where <v0,...,vn-1> is a simple path and vn = v0. (a path that comes back to itself)

Tree: a connected graph with no cycles.
	* Fact: ever n-vertex tree has n-1 edges.

Rooted Tree: A tree with a distinguished vertex called the root.
