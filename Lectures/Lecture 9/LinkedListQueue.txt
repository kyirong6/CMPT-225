Implementing a Queue with a Linked List
----------------------------------------

Consider: 

	[][] -> [][] -> [][] -> [][]

	* Easy to insert or remove the front
	* More difficult to remove or insert the rear
	* Can solve this by adding another pointer called: rear

Dequeue steps:
	1. Make a temo var to store value to return.
	2. Make a temp var to store a pointer to the node for deletion.
	3. Make front point to new front.
	4. delete unused node.
	5. return val.
