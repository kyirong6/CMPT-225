Linked Lists

- A sequence of simple objects (nodes), each storing one ...(plus a link..), linked together m a chain.

- Eg. to store the list <3,5,7>
	- [3] --> [5] --> [7]

- These objects have no names, (in contrast to declared variables)
	- we access them by following Links
		- in Java, references (implemented as pointers)
		- in c++, pointers




Eg. Implement a stack with a linked list
