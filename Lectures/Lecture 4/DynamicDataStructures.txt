Dynamic Data Structures

- Basic types (ints, chars, bool, ...) and arrays of these, store a fixed amount of data.

- We want implementations of ADTs like stacks + queues to grow and shrink as needed.
	- eg. vector, arraylist, string classes

- Basic Idea:
	- store data in a collection of (simple) objects
	- add/delete as needed
	- link them all together to make the main object.
