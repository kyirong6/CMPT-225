Computer Memory

- A sequence of locations
- Each location has an address
	- addresses are 0,1,...
	- typically written in hexadecimal
- Each location stores a byte of data
	-code is data too

*Naive models of memory. Just enough for this class.*


Memory Allocation (on a running system)

- memory is allocated to processes "as needed", according to some scheme.
	[ ] |
	[ ]	| } <---- code + data
	[ ] |
	[ ] |} <----- free memory.. 
	[ ] |
	[ ]
	[ ]

Variables and Memory

- A variable is (roughly) a named and typed collection of bytes allocated accordingly for its type.

- So, at run time, each variable has an address in memory
- In c,c++, we can
	- access the address of a variable
	- access a variable or memory location by its address
	- declare variables for storing addresses (pointers)
