Queue ADT:

- A collections of objects/values
- Ordered by insertion order
- Operations: enqueue (insert at rear). Dequeue (remove from top)
- FIFI


Queue Applications:

- Ubiquitous where a Limited "resource" is shared by multiple "clients" or most handle asynchrounous requests.

- Simple example: "Round-Robin Scheduling" for sharing a resource.
	1. Enqueue all jobs on Queue.
	2. Repeat { y = Q.dequeue
		    - service job y
		    - Q.enqueue(y)
		   }


Example: Recognizing Palindromes

- Palindromes "a" "abba"
- Algorithm: 1. Push all tokens, in order, onto both a queue and a stack
	     2. Remove pairs of tokens, checking for equality. 


- Not the best solution though.
