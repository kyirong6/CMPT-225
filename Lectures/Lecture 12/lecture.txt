Cor: Every complete binary tree with n nodes has height at most log(n)

Pf: We have that 2^h <= n.
	Taking log both sides: log2^h <= log(n)
							or h <= log(n)


Cor: Heap insert & extract_min both have time complexity O(logn)

Pf: Time is some constant times # of comparisons & swaps, which are both <= c*h < c*log(n)

# elements n
time for 1 operation: ceiling(log(n))
time for n operations: n*ceiling(log(n))
time for n operations using a naive implementation (array): n^2
