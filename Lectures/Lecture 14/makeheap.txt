Making a heap out of a binary tree:
-----------------------------------

pseudo:

make_heap(T) {
	for i = floor(n/2) - 1 down to 0 
		trickle_down(i)
}

We bound the number of swaps by:
	#swaps <= sum from d=0 to h-1: 2^d(h-d)
			  -------------------
--------------^ this is a range of depths at which we do trickledowns
-----------------------------------^ 2^d is the # of trickle_downs at depth d
----------------------------------------^ h-d is the max number of swaps for a node at depth d
